shared annotation for pdf

basic idea is to have a shared-annotation pdf document for something like a journal club

functionality
* you can scribble on pdf, and whatever you write is shared
* you can clear all scribbles on the pdf
* you can propagate your focus (transform matrix) to all others so they can see what you're seeing

desired functionality
* keep pdf format or reduce size of image, cause I'm currently converting pdf to an image so it's usable in html canvas
* make it tablet compatible
